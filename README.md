# 東風破 /plum/

Rime configuration manager and input schema repository

## Project home

[rime.im](https://rime.im)

## Introduction

**/plum/** is a configuration manager for [Rime](https://rime.im) input method engine.

/// **東風破** 是 [中州韻輸入法引擎](https://rime.im) 的配置管理工具。///

It's designed for Rime users to install and update the default configuration and a collection
of data packages maintained by [Rime Developers](https://github.com/rime).

It also works perfectly well with personal configuration hosted on GitHub and input schema packages
from third-party developers.

A **Rime input schema** (**Rime 輸入方案**) defines the rules of a specific "input method", or in technical terms
how user input sequences are interpreted by the Rime input method engine.
It consists of a configuration file named `<schema_id>.schema.yaml`, and usually an optional
**Rime dictionary** (**韻書**) file named `*.dict.yaml`.

A package may contain one or several interrelated input schemata and their affiliated Rime dictionaries.
A package is also good for publishing general configuration files and data files used by Rime.

In /plum/ terms, a re-usable piece of configuration is known as a **recipe** (**配方**), denoted by the "℞" symbol.

A data package itself can be a recipe, this is the common case.
In the future, /plum/ will support more fine-grained recipes that allow you to select what to install from a package,
or even take parameters like the target input schema to customize.

## Packages

This is an index of the packages maintained by Rime Developers as separate projects.

These packages aim to offer a sensible default configuration for most users, and support various
Chinese input methods including those based on modern dialects and historical Chinese phonology.

## Usage

To prepare your Rime configuration for [ibus-rime](https://github.com/rime/ibus-rime),
[Squirrel](https://github.com/rime/squirrel), you can get started by running

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/rime-install | bash
```

/// 用法：Linux、macOS 系統，在終端輸入以上命令行，安裝配置管理器及預設配方。 ///

Paste the command line in Linux terminal or macOS `Terminal.app` and hit enter.

The one-liner runs the `rime-install` script to download preset packages and install
source files to Rime user directory. (Yet it doesn't enable new schemas for you)

For [Weasel](https://github.com/rime/weasel), please refer to the [Windows bootstrap script](#windows) section for initial setup.

## Advanced usage

Alternatively, you can specify a configuration among `:preset`, `:extra` and `:all` (note the colon):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/rime-install | bash -s -- :preset
```

This is equivalent to cloning this repo and running the local copy of `rime-install`:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rime/plum.git
cd plum
bash rime-install :preset
```

You can then add packages from all the great Rime developers on GitHub by specifying
a list of package names or refer to packages by `<user>/<repo>`:

```sh
bash rime-install jyutping lotem/rime-zhung acevery/rime-zhengma

# optionally, specific a branch by appending "@<branch-name>"
bash rime-install jyutping@master lotem/rime-zhung@master
```

Lastly, it's also possible to install other author's Rime configuration from a
`*-packages.conf` file hosted on GitHub. For example:


```sh
bash rime-install https://github.com/lotem/rime-forge/raw/master/lotem-packages.conf

# or in short form: "<user>/<repo>/<filepath>"
bash rime-install lotem/rime-forge/lotem-packages.conf

# or specify a branch: "<user>/<repo>@<branch>/<filepath>"
bash rime-install lotem/rime-forge@master/lotem-packages.conf
```

For third-party Rime distributions, specify the `rime_frontend` variable in the command line:

```sh
rime_frontend=fcitx-rime bash rime-install
```

or set `rime_dir` to Rime user directory

```sh
rime_dir="$HOME/.config/fcitx/rime" bash rime-install
```

To update /plum/ itself, run

```sh
bash rime-install plum
```

## Interactively select packages to install

Specify the `--select` flag as the first argument to `rime-install`,
then add configurations (`:preset` is the default) and/or individual packages to display in the menu.

```sh
bash rime-install --select :extra

bash rime-install --select :all lotem/rime-forge/lotem-packages.conf
```

<a name="windows"></a>
## Windows bootstrap script

To get started on Windows, download the [bootstrap bundle][bootstrap-bundle],
unpack the ZIP archive and run `rime-install-bootstrap.bat` for initial setup.

It will fetch the latest installer script `rime-install.bat` an create a shortcut to it,
which can then be copied or moved anywhere for easier access.

/// Windows 用家可以通過 [小狼毫](https://rime.im/download/#windows) 0.11 以上「輸入法設定／獲取更多輸入方案」調用配置管理器。///

/// 或者下載獨立的 [啓動工具包][bootstrap-bundle]。///

  [bootstrap-bundle]: https://github.com/rime/plum-windows-bootstrap/archive/master.zip

### Use built-in ZIP package installer

You can use the installer script to download and install ZIP packages from GitHub, in a number of ways:

1. Double-click the shortcut to bring up an interactive package installer, then input package name, `<user>/<repo>` or GitHub URL for the package.

2. Run `rime-install.bat` in the command line. The command takes a list of packages to install as arguments.

```batch
rime-install :preset combo-pinyin jyutping wubi
```

3. Drag downloaded ZIP packages from GitHub onto the shortcut to do offline install.

   You can find ZIP packages downloaded by the installer script in `%TEMP%` folder (can be customized via variable `download_cache_dir`).

   To manually download ZIP package from a GitHub repository, click the button *Clone or download*, then *Download ZIP*.

### Use git for incremental updates (optional)

If [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is installed in the default location or is available in your `PATH`,
the script will use git-bash to install or update packages.

Use the following command to install Git for Windows, if you are new to git.
In China, it's probably faster to download Git from a local mirror by specifying `git_mirror`.

```batch
(set git_mirror=taobao) && rime-install git
```

You can set more options in `rime-install-config.bat` in the same directory as `rime-install.bat`, for example:

```batch
set git_mirror=taobao
set plum_dir=%APPDATA%\plum
set rime_dir=%APPDATA%\Rime
set use_plum=1
```

## Install as shared data

The `Makefile` builds and installs Rime data as a software on Unix systems.

For downstream packagers for the package management systems of the OS, it's recommend to create
separate packages for the /plum/ configuration manager (possibly named `rime-plum` or `rime-install`)
and the data package(s) (possibly named `rime-data`, or `rime-data-*` if separated into many)
created by the make targets.

### Build dependencies

  - git
  - librime>=1.3 (for `rime_deployer`)

### Run-time dependencies

  - librime>=1.3
  - opencc>=1.0.2

### Build and install

The default make target uses `git` command to download the latest packages from GitHub.

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

You can optionally build the by default enabled input schemas to binaries.
This saves user's time building those files on first startup.

```sh
make preset-bin
```
